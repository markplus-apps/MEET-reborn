Act as a **Senior Principal Software Architect** and **World-Class UI/UX Designer**. I want you to build "MarkPlus Meet", a premium, high-performance Meeting Room Booking System using **Next.js 14+ (App Router)**.

**GOAL:** Create a "Million Dollar App" experience. It must be mobile-first, visually stunning (Apple-like aesthetics), and extremely fast.

### 1. THE TECH STACK (Strict Requirements)
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router) with TypeScript.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + **Shadcn/UI** (use the latest version).
- **Animation:** **Framer Motion** (Mandatory for page transitions, card hovers, and modal appearances).
- **Database:** Prisma ORM connected to an external PostgreSQL.
- **Auth:** NextAuth.js v5 (Auth.js).
- **State Management:** TanStack Query (React Query) for data fetching.
- **Icons:** Lucide-React.
- **Feedback:** Sonner (for premium toast notifications).

### 2. DATABASE & CONNECTION
I have already set up the `DATABASE_URL` in the Replit Secrets (connecting to my private VPS).
- **Action:** Initialize Prisma immediately.
- **Provider:** Use `provider = "postgresql"` in `schema.prisma`.
- **Constraint:** Do NOT use SQLite. Connect directly to the provided Postgres URL.

### 3. DATABASE SCHEMA (Prisma Models)
Create these exact models with appropriate relationships:
- **User:** `id`, `name`, `email` (unique), `password` (hashed), `role` (enum: EMPLOYEE, ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN), `avatar`, `createdAt`.
- **Room:** `id`, `name`, `category` (enum: PUBLIC, SPECIAL), `capacity`, `facilities` (String[]), `imageUrl`, `isActive`.
- **Booking:** `id`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `title`, `description`, `userId`, `roomId`, `status` (CONFIRMED, CANCELLED, PENDING), `createdAt`.

### 4. BUSINESS LOGIC (The "MarkPlus" Rules)
- **Seeding (Crucial):** - Create 7 PUBLIC rooms: "Meet 1" to "Meet 7".
  - Create 3 SPECIAL rooms: "Philip Kotler Classroom", "MarkPlus Gallery", "Museum of Marketing".
- **Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Role `EMPLOYEE`: Can ONLY book `PUBLIC` rooms.
  - Role `ADMIN` & `SUPER_ADMIN`: Can book `ALL` rooms.
- **Conflict Logic:** Strictly prevent overlapping bookings for the same room.

### 5. UI/UX DESIGN GUIDELINES (World Class Standard)
- **Mobile-First Layout:**
  - **Mobile:** Implement a floating, glassmorphism **Bottom Navigation Bar** (Home, Book, My Schedule, Profile).
  - **Desktop:** A sleek, collapsible sidebar.
- **Visual Style:**
  - Use a "Bento Grid" layout for the Dashboard.
  - Use extensive **Glassmorphism** (backdrop-blur-md) on cards and headers.
  - Typography: Use `Inter` or `Geist Sans` for a clean, corporate look.
  - **Optimistic UI:** The app must feel instant. Show the booking as "done" immediately while processing in the background.
- **The Booking Experience (The "Wow" Factor):**
  - **Do NOT** use simple dropdowns for time.
  - **USE** a **Visual Timeline / Gantt View**: Users scroll horizontally to see time slots. Green blocks = Available, Red blocks = Booked.
  - Users tap an empty slot to book.

### 6. EXECUTION PLAN
1. **Setup:** Initialize the Next.js app with the stack above.
2. **Database:** Define Prisma schema and run `npx prisma db push` to connect to my VPS.
3. **Seed:** Run the seed script to populate the 10 rooms.
4. **Components:** Build the "World Class" UI components (Bottom Nav, Bento Grid, Timeline).
5. **Logic:** Implement Server Actions for booking with conflict checks.

**IMPORTANT:** Start by setting up the database connection and verifying you can talk to my VPS. Ask me for the `DATABASE_URL` if it's missing, otherwise, proceed immediately.
