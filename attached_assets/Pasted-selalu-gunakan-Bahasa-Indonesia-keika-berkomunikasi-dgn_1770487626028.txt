We are entering the **Refined POLISH PHASE**.
I have updated the `DATABASE_URL` in Secrets. Please ensure the app connects to the VPS Postgres, not the local SQLite.

I have 3 specific tasks to elevate the UX to "World Class" standards:

### TASK 1: MOBILE UX UPGRADE (The "Bottom Sheet")
The current Booking Modal looks cramped on mobile.
- **Requirement:** Implementation **Responsive Dialog**.
  - **Desktop:** Keep the current centered Dialog/Modal.
  - **Mobile:** Automatically switch to a **Bottom Sheet / Drawer** component (use `vaul` or Shadcn's `Drawer`).
- **Why:** This is the industry standard for mobile apps. It should slide up from the bottom and handle touch gestures (swipe down to close).

### TASK 2: "MODIFY" BOOKING FEATURE
Currently, I only see "Extend" and "Cancel". I need a **"Reschedule / Modify"** button.
- **Logic:**
  1. User clicks "Modify".
  2. Open the Booking Form pre-filled with existing data.
  3. Allow changing Date, Time, or even Room.
  4. On Submit: Run the **Overlap Check**. If valid, update the booking. If invalid, show error.

### TASK 3: UPDATE ROOM DATA (Hard Refactor)
Please update the `seed.ts` (database seeding script) and the Room Card UI to reflect EXACTLY these real-world specs:

1. **Meet 1:** Capacity: 30, Facilities: ["Projector", "Whiteboard"]
2. **Meet 2:** Capacity: 6, Facilities: ["Whiteboard]
3. **Meet 3:** Capacity: 6, Facilities: ["Monitor", "Whiteboard"]
4. **Meet 4:** Capacity: 8, Facilities: ["Monitor", "Whiteboard"]
5. **Meet 5:** Capacity: 8, Facilities: ["Whiteboard"]
6. **Meet 6:** Capacity: 8, Facilities: ["Whiteboard"]
7. **Meet 7:** Capacity: 8, Facilities: ["Monitor", "Whiteboard"]
8. **Philip Kotler Classroom:** Capacity: 150, Facilities: ["Projector", "Large Whiteboard", "Sound System"]
9. **MarkPlus Gallery:** Capacity: 100, Facilities: ["Projector", "Whiteboard", "Sound System"]
10. **Museum of Marketing:** Capacity: 50, Facilities: ["Projector", "Large Whiteboard", "Sound System"]

**EXECUTION ORDER:**
1. Update the Seed Script & Room Config first.
2. Implement the "Modify" logic.
3. Refactor the Booking Modal to use `Drawer` on mobile (Check `useMediaQuery` hook).

**NOTE:** Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is used. Retest the Legacy Sync after these changes.
